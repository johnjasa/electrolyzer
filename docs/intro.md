# Welcome to the Electrolyzer Documentation

This repo contains electrolyzer models for use in techno-economic analysis of hydrogen production systems.
The models are designed to be used in conjunction with the [HOPP](https://github.com/NREL/HOPP) and [H2Integrate (formerly GreenHEART)](https://github.com/NREL/greenheart) models developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).
